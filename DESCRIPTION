Description: This package implements the simulations and data analysis examples
    for preconditioned least-squares regression as in (Homrighausen and McDonald,
    2016). Essentially, the design matrix is premultiplied by a sparse matrix,
    reducing the number of available observations from n to q. However, the addition
    of a ridge penalty results in estimates of the true coefficient vector with
    lower mean-squared error, even relative to ridge regression (in some cases). The
    result is improved computation and better statistical accuracy.
